// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Start
2. Declare integer variable num
3. Ask the user to input a number
4. If num mod 2 equals 0
     a. Print "The number is even"
   Else
     a. Print "The number is odd"
5. End


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Start
2. Declare integer array numbers[5]
3. Declare integer variables i, sum, min, max
4. Initialize sum to 0
5. For i from 0 to 4
     a. Ask the user to input number and store it in numbers[i]
     b. Add numbers[i] to sum
     c. If i is 0
          i. Set min and max to numbers[i]
        Else
          i. If numbers[i] < min, set min to numbers[i]
          ii. If numbers[i] > max, set max to numbers[i]
6. Calculate average as sum / 5
7. Print "The average is" followed by average
8. Print "The smallest number is" followed by min
9. Print "The largest number is" followed by max
10. End
